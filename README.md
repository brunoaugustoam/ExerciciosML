# ML Exercises
Machine Learning Projects developed for training

I did some exercises for classifying exoplanets using shallow machine learning models.
 - Naive Bayes
 - Decision Tree
 - SVM (Kernals: Linear, Polinomial, RBF, Sigmoid)
 - K-NN
 - Random Forest
 - Gradient Tree Boosting

Also, I wrote a brief review of some commonly used metrics to evaluate model training and compare their performance.
