# ML_projects
Machine Learning Projects developed for training and as part of master modules at the Federal University of Minas Gerais

Here I made open my personal exercise for the classification of exoplanets using shallow machine learning models.
 - Naive Bayes
 - Decision Tree
 - SVM (Kernals: Linear, Polinomial, RBF, Sigmoid)
 - K-NN
 - Random Forest
 - Gradient Tree Boosting

Also, I wrote a brief review of some commonly used metrics to evaluate model training and compare their performance.

Available in Portuguese-Brazil. English version coming soon.
